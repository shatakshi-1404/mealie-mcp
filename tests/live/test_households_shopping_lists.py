"""Live test for the household shopping list lifecycle.

Stages a sentinel shopping list, exercises the get, list, rename, and delete
tools, and asserts the rename preserves the list's items and extras. Two items
and an extras key are seeded before the rename, so a regression in
fetch-then-merge would clobber either ``listItems`` or ``extras`` on the
PUT-replace and fail the test. Cleanup runs even when the body fails so no
`mcp-test-` data lingers.
